However, azurin release happens only if the physician confirms the correct localization of the bacteria via MRI and subsequently heats them via focused ultrasound, which activates a thermo-inducible cell lysis system.\r\n\n", "award": "Nominated for Best Therapeutics Project, Overgrad|Best Poster, Overgrad|Nominated for Best Poster, Overgrad|Best Model, Overgrad|Nominated for Best Model, Overgrad|Nominated for Best New Basic Part, Overgrad", "medal": "gold"}, "2448": {"team_id": "2448", "team_url": "http://igem.org/Team.cgi?team_id=2448", "team_name": "Evry_Paris-Saclay", "wiki": "http://2017.igem.org/Team:Evry_Paris-Saclay", "region": "Europe", "country": "France", "track": "Food & Nutrition", "kind": "Collegiate", "application": "Accepted", "section": "Overgraduate\n", "title": "Psicose\n", "abstract": "The World Health Organisation recognized obesity as a serious illness so we decided to consider ways to combat it\u0092s spread and effects.
