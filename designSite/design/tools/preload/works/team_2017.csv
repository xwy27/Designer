","Salt Vault
","Decreasing fresh water availability is not only a problem for desert climate regions like North-Africa and the Middle East, but also for European countries like Germany or the Netherlands, where water pollution is mainly caused by industry.
We are modifying the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to increase the uptake of various ions into the cell and store these inside its vacuole. This will be achieved by upregulation of native (vacuolar) ion importers and knock-out of ion exporters. Furthermore, we are expressing heterologous genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in yeast to improve vacuolar ion accumulation, thus creating a microbial dustbin.
With this newly generated library of genetically engineered yeasts, we hope to offer a novel way of treating water contaminated by industrial processes and store pollutants in our intracellular reservoir, the Salt Vault. Then this concept can be employed by industries facing problems with high pollution in their process water.

","Porifi - Purify your pores from acne bacteria
","Acne vulgaris affects 85% of adolescents at some point of their life, influencing their self-esteem negatively. Currently, antibiotics are among the most common acne treatments. However, 50% of bacteria associated with acne are already resistant to the antibiotics used. Our project aims to develop a novel treatment for acne using an antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, naturally found in human sweat. Dermcidin has shown to be active against Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium associated with acne.  Patients with acne also have reduced expression of dermcidin, which suggests that it might contribute to the condition. We aim to produce dermcidin tied to a cellulose-binding domain, which would enable the immobilization of the peptide on a cellulose surface. This would allow the usage of dermcidin in various skin care products, such as hydrogel masks and exfoliation pads.

","Irrespective of where you come from, we all share the global responsibility of ensuring that our societies are sustainable. We have been depleting the worlds resources and filling the atmosphere with abnormal levels of CO2 for too long. Our team has decided to take on this challenge by creating photosynthetic cell factories, to directly use the pollutant CO2 as a resource for synthesizing fumarate - a versatile chemical traditionally manufactured from petroleum. We aim to stably produce, sense and export fumarate under conditions mimicking industrial settings. Stable production is achieved by activating and evolving different metabolic modules in response to natural day/night cycles. To detect fumarate, we developed a biosensor suitable for high-throughput screening. Finally, to allow optimal fumarate export, we investigate its transport mechanism. These efforts attracted attention from beyond academia, as our cell factories may help in taking CO2 out of thin air and into a bio-based economy.

","EVR-QST: Engineering Variable Regulators for a Quorum Sensing Toolbox
","Homoserine lactones (HSLs) are a family of small molecules used to coordinate behavior in some bacteria. Group regulation is known as quorum sensing (QS) and is responsible for behaviors such as bacterial virulence, growth, and bioluminescence. Genetic components from QS systems have been modularized by synthetic biologists and incorporated into synthetic circuits. A significant hurdle to using HSLs in synthetic systems is cross-reactivity between a sender and non-target receivers. Crosstalk can be mitigated by orthogonal systems that do not communicate with each other. Our project characterizes interactions between HSL-producing sender cells and our newly developed receivers (LasR, TraR, and RpaR) using an HSL-induced GFP reporter system. We expect to add 3 new well-characterized receivers to build upon foundational advances such as the work with LuxR (BBa_F2620) by B. Canton.

","Promoting CRC Detection
","Colorectal cancer is the second most lethal cancer in the United States, often beginning as benign polyps in the colon and rectum. Despite ease of treatment, cases of CRC are usually detected in its late stages, rendering care difficult. CRC results from the mutation of multiple genes involved with the regulation of cell proliferation and DNA repair, with the ASIJ iGEM team focusing on the Wnt pathway. The activation of the Wnt pathway inhibits the degradation of beta-catenin, a protein that triggers the mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Through detection of these mutated genes and subsequent downstream proteins, our team aims to develop an early screening method that can be adapted to a home detection kit. Building off of a rapamycin induced split-luciferase system characterized by the 2015 Peking iGEM team, our construct consists of a promoter reporter system that looks at two downstream products, C-myc and COX-2.

Therefore, our innovative toolkit for the translational incorporation of ncAAs in E. coli is a valuable contribution to iGEM. Directed evolution of tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs enables the site-specific incorporation of ncAAs into peptides. This approach results in an optimal orthogonality to the autologous translation apparatus and a high flexibility concerning the incorporation of multiple ncAAs.

We thought to construct a pathway to synthesize amino acids from nitrogen in E.coli, introduce it into the intestine in the future. To synthesize amino acids, we first express nitrogenase to convert nitrogen to ammonia. We then express amino acid dehydrogenases to synthesize glutamate and phenylalanine from accumulated ammonia. This makes it possible to make people available to protein sources by breathing the air. This will contribute to the solution of protein shortage.

","Bristol BREATHE: BioReactor to Eliminate Atmospheric Threats to Health and the Environment
","Nitrogen oxide (NOx) gas levels in Bristol are unacceptable. Produced predominantly by car emissions, NOx causes significant morbidity and mortality; it exacerbates lung disease and in Bristol alone kills 300 people per year (8.5% of deaths). NOx is also the third most detrimental greenhouse gas. We aim to engineer E. coli to metabolise NOx using the cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NrfA), which reduces nitrite (NO2-) to ammonia, and the Nap periplasmic nitrate reductase to convert nitrate (NO3-) to nitrite. As NOx dissolves to form both nitrite and nitrate, the use of Nap will improve efficiency. The ammonia produced could be used to make fertiliser, or electricity if incorporated into a microbial fuel cell. An agent-based bacterial model will be adapted to predict system efficiency and behaviour. We aim to contain our bacteria within pods to be strategically placed in the most polluted areas, based on our atmospheric pollution modelling.

","aGROW
","A single species of bacteria is responsible for many plant diseases - Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Infection with this bacteria causes bizarre growths and tumors on plants that repurpose the plant cell to reallocate its nutrients to the bacterial cell, causing plant death and agricultural loss. In Agrobacterium, the ability to infect a plant is contained in a tumour inducing plasmid which can spread through conjugation between cells. Here we have constructed aGROW, a strain of Agrobacterium capable of disarming pathogenic Agrobacterium and remediating infected soil. We have armed aGROW with a stable plasmid carrying a CRISPR/Cas9 system programmed to remove a key virulence region of the tumour inducing plasmid. Our plasmid employs a separate conjugation system to carry itself through a population of Agrobacterium, preventing them from becoming virulent. We envision this system to be adaptable in disarming other virulent plasmids such as those found in Shigella, Salmonella, and E. coli.

A large number of gene knock-out, transcriptional or translational silencing methods were applied for mutator strain generation.

","Affordable, Paper-based Assay For Detection Of Arsenic Contamination
","Arsenic is a toxic chemical that can be naturally occurring or a result of industrial contamination. The identification of dangerous arsenic concentrations in groundwater and soil is important because arsenic poses a serious health risk to living organisms. Unfortunately, arsenic testing is expensive, time consuming, and requires sophisticated equipment. This is especially relevant to soldiers deployed to resource-scarce, field environments. Our team is using synthetic biology to develop a more affordable, portable, and accessible means of testing. We designed a plasmid that uses ArsR, a negative transcriptional repressor, to regulate the expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). In the presence of arsenic, ArsR will undergo a conformational change that allows GFP expression. The assay is performed using a low cost paper ticket made by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center and analyzed with ultraviolet light. The development of this circuit would provide an inexpensive way to evaluate arsenic contamination.

","Crude oil is composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds that are difficult to degrade and environmentally harmful. It is crucial to find a time and cost effective procedure that will catabolize some of the most prevalent, toxic PAHs -- fluorene, phenanthrene, and naphthalene -- to innocuous compounds, such as salicylate and phthalate, which are degradable in metabolic cycles. Certain bacteria contain intermediates in their degradative pathways that simplify gene combination and nucleotide sequencing. We proposed a novel methodology for the degradation of multiple PAHs through the implementation of these bacteria-derived pathways into E. coli. This methodology allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs within an oil environment into safer residues. A broad host vector can be used to transfer the sequences degradation capabilities into strains different from E. coli. These bacteria can be incorporated in oil spill remediations and bioreactor use, achieving detoxification through combinatorial genetic bioremediation.

","DTU Snakebite Detectives: Diagnostic Tool for Venom Discrimination
","Envenomation by snakebite is one of the most neglected diseases with an estimated 5 million cases each year. These result in an estimated 100,000 deaths and 400,000 disabilities annually. The only effective treatment is animal derived antivenoms, which frequently causes adverse reactions. As a result, they are often only administered as a last resort.

We aim to develop a detection-assay that enables us to determine what type of snake a victim is envenomed by. The strategy is to target distinguishable enzymatic features in the different snake venoms by developing suitable substrate-based diagnostics. Our diagnostic tool can be useful in identifying the relative composition of specific venom components in a blood sample and thereby allow for the safest course of treatment.

","An affordable HIV & Zika rapid lateral flow diagnostic using thermostable griffithsin
","Our project focuses on developing a lateral flow assay-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for inexpensive, early-stage, point-of-care diagnosis of HIV and Zika. Treatment access and public health interventions for these diseases are seriously limited by diagnostics, as current RDTs detect either poorly-conserved viral antigens or the patients own delayed antibody response and thus are unable to reliably diagnose early-stage infection, while more sophisticated tests are not widely accessible where the disease burden is greatest. Our novel approach enables modular, early-stage detection within an inexpensive, scalable RDT format by using a lectin to detect carbohydrates universal to a number of important viral pathogens in combination with antibodies targeting virus-specific conserved sites. Additionally, we have rationally engineered a thermostable variant of the diagnostic lectin to improve manufacturing economics and device robustness. By enabling earlier and larger-scale diagnosis, we hope this approach will help to improve interventions for these critical global health challenges.

","Developing the Fluoride Riboswitch as a Technology to Combat Excessive Water Fluoridation
","Most water sources in developing countries are decentralized. Consequently, drinking water is prone to high levels of fluoride from geological sources, corresponding to endemic fluorosis and may lead to developmental or reproductive defects. Underdeveloped regions in rapidly developing countries, such as China and India, have triple the recommended WHO limit of fluoride in their groundwater. Our project seeks to develop the fluoride riboswitch, an mRNA that can bind to fluoride and regulate the expression of downstream genes, as a technology to combat fluoride contamination in water. We developed a system where the fluoride riboswitch controls the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, allowing bacteria to grow on the antibiotic chloramphenicol in the presence of fluoride. We will use this operon to screen and select riboswitches with higher responsiveness to fluoride. We envision using engineered fluoride riboswitch systems as tools to sequester, bioremediate, or detect fluoride in a cost effective manner.

","CATE - Cancer-Targeting E. coli
","Treating cancer remains a challenge for modern medicine. Current treatments are often invasive, time-consuming and limited by toxic effects on healthy tissue.

An ideal therapeutic should be effective, safe and targeted. We engineered a non-pathogenic strain of E. coli to approach this goal. The combination of autonomous targeting, visualization and externally controlled toxin release provides a novel non-invasive, quick and safe approach to treating cancer. 

Specifically, following intravenous administration, our E. coli preferentially populates solid tumors due to the properties of the tumor microenvironment. Intracellular accumulation of the cytotoxin azurin and the MRI contrast agent bacterioferritin is controlled by an AND gate which is activated once a population threshold is reached AND lactate, a tumor marker, is present. However, azurin release happens only if the physician confirms the correct localization of the bacteria via MRI and subsequently heats them via focused ultrasound, which activates a thermo-inducible cell lysis system.

We could fight most bacterial threats for a long time which lead to a notion of false comfort that everything is under control! However, with the current overuse of antibiotics and acquired resistances among bacteria we are about to enter a new era, the post antibiotic era.
We are now reaching the tipping point, at which new strategies are required to overcome multiresistance and prevent a resurgence of devastating infections. Our Project will help to combat multiresistant-infections with a Trojan-Horse-Approach utilizing gallium-loaded siderophores as a resistance-resistant therapy.

","Optimizing Curli Fiber Production as a Scalable Materials Manufacturing Platform
","Curli fibers, the main proteinaceous component in E. coli biofilms, polymerize extracellularly to form a macroscopic agglomeration of material when isolated in sufficient bulk. It has been demonstrated that functional peptide domains can be fused to the self-polymerizing units of curli to form a variety of functional materials. Thus, curli fibers present a promising platform for the scalable production of programmable materials.

Our project focuses on optimizing curli production on two fronts. First, we aim to increase curli export efficiency by optimizing the stoichiometric ratio of proteins involved in the curli pathway. Second, we aim to optimize the conditions for protein-producing cell cultures by growing them in a bioreactor. Our work along these two lines will inform the further development of the curli system as a feasible biosynthetic platform for producing materials at industrially relevant yields.

","Nickel Hunter: a biosensor that detects nickel ions in the natural environment
","China is the world's largest producer and consumer of nickel ions. However, nickel and its compounds are one of the primary pollutants in China. They mainly derive from electroplating, nickel metal processing and battery manufacturing. Nickel and its compounds released from the industry  have detrimental effects on the environment and hence threaten human health.  Therefore, nickel is one of the heavy metals that are often monitored in the environment and food chains. The traditional nickel detecting method is to implement chemical measurement of nickel-containing samples in the laboratory, which is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to operate. Thus, we expect to create a cheap, user-friendly E. coli biosensor, a type of bacterium that produces fluorescence protein when it detects nickel ions in the environment. Consequently, we can find out the amount of nickel ions existing in a certain environment by examining the intensity of fluorescence produced by the probing bacteria.

","THE PHAGE AND THE FURIOUS 
","Darwinian evolution is an enormously powerful concept that drove biology towards astonishing complexity and beauty. This year, the iGEM team Heidelberg aims at harnessing this power to accelerate the engineering of biomolecules for human benefit. To this end, we built upon the PACE (phage-assisted continuous evolution) method: Synthetic biological circuits couple the survival of quickly mutating phages carrying a protein of interest to directed selection within E. coli hosts. Thereby, proteins with improved functions can be evolved within hours.
We designed a standardized toolbox that highly simplifies PACE and expands its utility towards various new areas of application, including the development of enzymes for pharmaceutical production. Additionally, we applied machine learning techniques to evaluate and systematically improve protein sequences to serve a desired purpose. Taken together, we provide a new foundational advance by introducing a unique combination of in silico and in vivo directed evolution to Synthetic Biology.

","Pickles have long been an important part in the worldwide diet. But the nitrite generated in the production of pickles has always been a concerning problem to health and food safety, due to its conversion to carcinogenic nitrosamine once taken up by humans. Currently, most industrial production of pickles relies on the natural decomposing process of nitrite, which is inefficient and often takes months to complete. To make an improvement, we designed a bio-device to make the degradation of nitrite more rapid and environmental-friendly. Our device consists of a positive feedback loop device followed by a fusion enzyme which can reduce nitrite to nitrogen and oxygen. The feedback loop is regulated by a nitrite/nitrate specific promoter to ensure the expression of downstream function proteins only in pickles environment. Our solution drastically shorten the production period and increases profit margin for the multibillion-dollar pickled vegetables industry.

","E.co Circle
","In stock-breeding, animals are fed with grains that contain phytic acids though many livestock are not capable of producing phytase, an enzyme that decomposes phytic acid, and remaining phytic acid is excreted in the excrement. Excreted phytic acid flows into rivers and leads to eutrophication that causes problems such as red tide, which exerts adverse effects on ecosystem and fishery.
Under the status quo, people try to cope with this problem by adding phytase to the feed of livestock however, its enzyme activity is thought to be lowered when it is heated during its production. Moreover, the low pH in the stomach of livestock may also lower its activity.
In our project, we aim to increase stability against heat and extreme pH by circularizing enzyme using self-assembling peptides (SAPs) which could decrease the amount of phosphate in the excrement and enhance nutrition absorption since phytic acids chelate minerals.

To circumvent the shortcomings, we present an alternative safety circuit which is capable of sensing and amplifying a signalling molecule under a time-delay mechanism. After the time-delay, the circuit will trigger the production of a recombinase that splices out the genetically modified segment from the origin of replication (ORI) of the carrier vector, thus preventing replication of the genetically modified segment in the host. Through this genetic containment approach, we hope to create a standardized design to lower the risk of leakage of genetically modified materials to the environment and alleviate public concerns.

This was achieved by using four mutations, two in HEPN1 and two in the HEPN2 domains, which although ablating nuclease activity, still permitted dCAS13a to bind the target RNA sequence. In tandem we designed guide RNAs for targeting mRNA of four cytosolic proteins. Visualization of the dCAS13a was achieved by fusion with a GFP, and to enhance target detection, a nuclear localization sequence sequestered the dCas13a-GFP in the nucleus until needed in the cytosol, thus reducing background noise. We have performed verification tests, constructed mathematical models and developed multiple tools for public engagement. Our findings will lead to the development of a new tool for research and potentially in diagnostic laboratories.

","Microbes of the Night
","In synthetic biology, its essential to implement control mechanisms that disable microbes that are unintentionally released into the enviroment. Teams have developed 'kill-switches', or toxic genes are activated under selected conditions. We decided to create a light-inducible kill-switch, based on the design by Wageningen 2016. This complements our previous project (which we are continuing to explore); enhancing E. coli metabolism for wastewater treatment, in dark conditions. The kill-switch is based upon the pDawn system, activating transcription in the presence of blue light. It features MazF, a mRNA-targeting endonuclease. We have designed controls to verify the expression pattern. Furthermore, we introduced additional layers of regulation to prevent premature cell death. Completion of our previous work, together with our kill-switch, is a step towards an environmentally friendly and safe bacterium for nitrogen removal. Moreover, the creation of an effective light inducible kill-switch is a useful addition to the synthetic biology toolkit.

","Tea Ceremony Master Bug: Evaluating Tea Quality with a Biosensor for L-theanine
","The aim of our project is to create a biosensor for evaluating the concentration of L-theanine.
 
Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in particular plants, especially in tea plant (Camellia sinensis). Theanine boosts alpha brain waves, promoting relaxation. In addition, theanine is one of the taste ingredients of green tea, which is called as umami in Japanese, meaning pleasant savory taste. For these reasons, green tea containing the more theanine is considered to have the higher quality. 

Currently, the theanine content in green tea is measured by instrumental analysis depending on the expensive equipment. To reduce the cost and special technique required for the measurement, we aimed at developing a bacterial sensor to evaluate the theanine content in green tea based on identification of the genes in Bacillus subtillis that are induced in the presence of theanine.

","HEKcite: Measuring frequency change of an artificial rhythm in HEK cells for therapeutic drug monitoring
","Lack of continuous therapeutic drug monitoring is associated with increased health costs, morbidity and mortality. A more dynamic sensing system could improve the therapy and quality of life of patients taking drugs with a narrow therapeutic range. Here, an electrically oscillating system consisting of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells is proposed. After transfecting HEK cells with genes encoding key ion channels, an intrinsic rhythm of subsequent de- and repolarization was obtained. Molecular substrates, such as drugs, can open or close these ion channels and thus affect the frequency of the rhythm. This change in frequency can then be measured in vivo by use of a multi-electrode array and correlated to the concentration of the drugs in the blood. Additionally, substrate specificity can be chosen by integration of a certain substrate-sensitive ion channel into the oscillating system. This multipurpose sensor could be developed for medical and biotechnological applications.

","B.xylophilus Busters-the attempt to kill pine-wood nematodes by feeding RNAi
","Pine-wilt disease caused by Bursaphelenchus xylophilus causes tremendous damage to pines in Asia and Europe. However, the existing counter-measures are not only insufficient, but also cause environmental and ecological damage. 
 We engineered a solution to killing nematodes effectively and specifically by focusing on the nematode's diet: yeast living inside pines. We selected target genes which were both nematode-specific and predicted to be essential for survival. We then engineered yeast which express dsRNA targeting these genes, with the goal of feeding the engineered yeast to the nematodes to knock down their genes (feeding RNAi). Furthermore, we predict that engineered yeast may be used to colonize healthy pines, functioning as a preventive measure against nematode infestation. 
 The behavior of dsRNA in yeast is still not well understood, and establishment of a feeding RNAi system in pine-wood nematodes is unprecedented. Thus, our method will also support fundamental research on RNAi and pine-wood nematodes.

We focused on the fermented food called Funazushi which rooted in the area where we live in.
We will develop nutritious food by recombining yeast which was dominant species of Funazushi and making yeast produces nutrients lacking in the area.
Because Funazushi is high salt concentration and low pH state during fermentation ,we will try to create yeast which make necessary nutrients for nation which is troubled by starvation while have resistance to high salt concentration and low pH.

","Three Microbial Whole-Cell Sensing Systems to Detect Gas Molecules in the Environment
","Formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen pose great danger to our lives. Traditional methods for detecting them are mainly based on irreversible redox reactions in expensive devices with short life spans, whereas whole-cell bacterial biosensors have major advantages over traditional analyses with regard to specificity, sensitivity and portability.

We attempt to develop whole-cell systems detecting these gases. We have managed to transfer gene clusters encoding translational suppressors or activator into E. coli to respond to different gas molecules by up regulation of specific downstream genes. In order to visualize the gases existence and concentration, FP genes are inserted in the expression system after the promoter influenced by the suppressor or activator. At present, results have shown sensibility at a µM level.

As long as proper containers are designed, we will be able to construct portable sensors by which users can perform instant on-site monitoring with higher sensitivity, stability but lower costs.

Based on previously discovered relevant genes, we attempt to search for crucial genes for aniline degradation in Acinetobacter sp. strain YAA, and perform gene recombination and expression, meanwhile construct recombinant genetic engineering bacteria, and test the bioremediation effects in contaminated waterbodies and soil samples. Results show that recombined target gene could efficiently express in E. coli, and that the engineered bacteria acquired from three-parent hybridization express a wider range of substrate spectrum, thus laying the foundation for further bioremediation research.

LA inducibly secretes serine, LB constitutively secretes leucine, and LC makes acyl-CoA synthetase long chain (ACSL) to metabolize fatty acids.

Our research aims to build a mammalian cell-based biological odor detection system (iSmeller, intensified Smeller) with enhanced sensitivity by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 activation technology. Once an odor binds to the specific olfactory receptors on the cell membrane, it leads to a series of signaling rally and consequently generates a flux of cAMP (cyclic AMP) which could be detected by a cAMP-activated reporter gene system. We implement CRISPR activation apparatus to simultaneously amplify several core components endogenously along the olfactory signal cascade to enhance power and sensitivity of the cellular odor sensor. We will evaluate the performance of iSmeller with two odor/receptor pairs: β-citronellol/OR1A1 and bourgeonal/OR1D2.

","æther : an innovative air-purifying biomaterial
","Indoor air pollution is a worldwide threat and existing solutions are limited as stated by experts we met. Our aim is to design an air purifying device. Not only will it capture toxic compounds present in the air, but it will also degrade them using enzymes. As a proof of concept, we have chosen Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as targets, since they are some of the most dangerous volatile air pollutants. The enzymatic pathway we have elaborated will degrade PAHs into pyruvate, a physiological compound. Our system and its coating will not release any GMOs. After meetings and discussions with the general public, health specialists, air quality regulators, law and political actors, we have designed an affordable and user-friendly device, æther. Indeed, it consists of an energetically autonomous DIY kit based on simple materials, so that people with low income and restricted access to electricity can also benefit from it.

","Genetic Sequential Logic Programming
","Complex gene regulation requires responses that depend not only on the current levels of input but also on signals received in the past, enabling temporal variation in cell behavior. In digital circuit theory, this information-processing paradigm refers to sequential logic.

We developed recombinase parts that can stably edit DNA sequences and demonstrated their capability of implementing sequential logic in cell. The core of sequential logic is the memory module to store past events. We built a bio-flip-flop with similar function as its electronic counterpart, which can store one bit of memory. By incorporating repressilator into the system, we aim to trigger cell state transition with an intracellular oscillation clock signal. We also developed an automated method to generate genetic sequential logic circuits according to customized specification of inputs and responses in different temporal states, namely the 3D truth table.

","Selective modification of yeast MFE2 gene improves the efficiency of medium-chain length sophorolipid production.
","Sophorolipids are a group of amphipathic compounds synthesized by yeasts, including our selected chassis Starmerella bombicola. These compounds are among the most industrially viable biosurfactants. As surfactants, sophorolipids are superior to current synthetic alternatives largely due to their low toxicity and ready biodegradability. Anti-cell proliferation and anti-microbial assays suggest that medium-chain length sophorolipids possess therapeutic potential. However, their higher cost of production poses a major barrier to commercial use. Even when grown on a substrate largely composed of fatty acids, a significant portion of the fatty acids are diverted from sophorolipid production due to competition with the β-oxidation pathway. Fatty acids diverted into the β-oxidation pathway undergo irregular cleavage, lowering sophorolipid yield and creating a heterogeneous mixture of products. Full suppression of this pathway would result in undesirable metabolic disruption. Selective suppression of this pathway through genetic engineering could reduce production costs through improving the yield of useful chain lengths.

Scale insects are pests which threaten agriculture and gardening industry. Because of its harmfulness and tenacity, a large amount of contact pesticide is used yearly to repress its outbreak. In this project, E. coli was applied to selectivity degrade the thick shell of scale insects. Three kinds of enzymes are expressed in E. coli to degrade the chitin, protein and wax shell, which make it possible for pesticide to penetrate the shell. To avoid hurting plantswax-protein surface, a sucrose-induced enzyme release system is introduced, which utilizes the insect's honeydew secretion. Though pests may not be killed directly by E. coli, there is a huge decrease in pesticides needed in the killing process, which saves much money and brings numerous benefits to environment.

Many respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis are characterized by an excessive accumulation of thick mucus. Afflicted people suffer repeated lung infections and breathing difficulties caused by clogged airways, resulting in severely reduced quality of life. We address this issue by developing an unprecedented probiotic approach that self-regulates mucus thickness to protect and promote respiratory health. Our engineered bacteria sense the pathologically altered osmotic pressure caused by thickened mucus, thus triggering the expression of mucus degrading enzymes. For a proof-of-concept we degrade mucus, envisioning to clear the airways and consequentially remove entrapped pathogens and harmful particles. As pioneers in the field of lung probiotics, we challenge conventional treatments by exploring the lung microbiome as a potential solution to manage mucus-related respiratory diseases.

These bacteriocins have shown effective inhibitory activity against MRSA strains; they form pores to penetrate the membrane of the pathogenic strain. We tested if the hybrid bacteriocins will have a synergistic effect and compared their cytotoxicity over time to that of the individual bacteriocins against MRSA. This was done by conducting two assays: minimum inhibitory concentration and the spot-on-lawn. Through development of hybrids, we aim to optimize the activity of bacteriocins and treat bacterial infections, particularly those with antibiotic resistance.

","ReguloGEM - the ideal regulatory BioBrick 
","Synthetic biologists over the years have regulated protein expression using two types of regulators - transcriptional and translational. While transcriptional regulators are easily composable and are capable of regulating multiple genes(operons) and complex genetic circuits, they are difficult to engineer. On the other hand, translational regulators are not capable of regulating multiple genes and complex genetic circuits but can be easily engineered de novo using predictive thermodynamic models. Hence an ideal regulator is found wanting, one which is capable of regulating multiple genes simultaneously and at the same time easily engineerable.

ReguloGEM provides such a regulator based on the tnaC operon. This regulator termed the Adaptor is capable of converting the translational regulatory property of riboswitches into transcriptional regulation.

In this project, we want to develope a QS tool kit for Gram-positive bacteria. We will build this tool kit based on the Agr system from S.aureus, the PlcR-PapR system from Bacillus cereus, and the AimR-AimP system from the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage Phi3T. We are going to test the utility of this tool kit in Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis. This QS tool kit will facilitate synthetic biologists to construct more sophisticated systems, both in Gram-positive bacteria and mixed microbial consortia.

","Transformation of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4) to Intestinal Gut Microflora: A possible alternative of Gluten-free Diet""
","Gluten-related disorders, including celiac disease(CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, are found worldwide. Currently available therapy for CD patients, permanent gluten-free diet(GFD), has drawbacks of restricted nutrition and lifelong remission. Thus, we considered a non-dietary therapy that utilizes synthetic biology targeting the gut microflora. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4(DPP-4) gene, which is known to decompose the gluten, was inserted to the iGEM provided vectors through infusion cloning based on the 3A Assembly method. Western blot analysis using Flag-tag was conducted to verify the expression of the target gene. Because excessive expression of DPP-4 may induce stress and inflammation, we added Anderson promoter that differentially regulates gene expression in three levels to achieve optimal expression of DPP-4 of an individual. The transformed dominant gut bacteria can be embedded into a bacteria-favorable yogurt for the subsequent probiotic administration. This study proposes a potential novel treatment of gluten-related disorders through recombinant gut bacteria

","Coli Sapiens: Co-Culture System of Human Cells and Bacteria Sustained by Cross-Kingdom Talk
","Gene therapy has been expected in cancer therapy for years. An interesting therapy for cancer using anaerobic bacteria as a carrier has been developed, but after the anaerobic cancer region is diminished, the bacteria cannot stay there anymore. If anti-cancer bacteria can stay in affected area, they promptly respond to cancer recurrence. Co-existence of bacteria and host cells should be quite difficult in our body or human cell culture systems, because bacteria grow so fast. It is important to control bacterial proliferation in them. So, we try to establish a new living system that human cells control the population of bacteria by engineering the both cells by creating two signaling pathways of 1) Bacteria-Mammals and 2) Bacteria-Plants. We expect that this system will lead to a new experimental approach and a new medical therapy. Moreover, we imagine about ""A boundary between cellular groups and living organisms"" with general public.

","Cancer Research Utilizing CRISPR based ecDNA Modification
","Cancer, a genetic disease resulting in uncontrollable cell growth, is mostly caused by somatic mutations acquired throughout an individuals lifetime. Because it induces the increased expression of growth related genes, oncogene amplification is one of the driving forces of cancer cell replication.  Recently, it was discovered that some oncogenes resided on extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA). Like the DNA on chromosomes, ecDNAs are double stranded. A key difference, however, is the circular shape of ecDNAs; they are able to randomly distribute because they do not have centromeres, which increases heterogeneity in daughter cells. This can cause the cancerous tumors to develop faster resistance to current treatments. To target the ecDNA, we used CRISPR technology to create double strand breaks specifically in the ecDNA. Because ecDNA causes oncogene copy number to increase exponentially, utilizing CRISPR to create breaks in ecDNA decreases cancer cells replication speed.

","The existing methods to detect the presence of a specific RNA sequence in a sample are laborious and require both trained personnel and sophisticated lab equipment. Inevitably, these restrictions limit the development of diagnostic detection methods based on specific RNA sequences. Here, we aimed to overcome these limitations by using the CRISPR-Cas protein Cas13a. Once this recently characterized protein binds to its complementary target, it unspecifically cleaves all surrounding RNA. Utilizing this property we designed a system for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in agricultural pathogens, aiming to combat the global rise of antibiotic resistance. We developed a procedure to extract biological samples and detect RNA sequences of interest by converting the collateral cleavage activity of Cas13a to a read-out visible to the naked eye. Through ongoing interaction with direct stakeholders, we made substantial progress towards making not only durable components but a cheap, safe and reliable detection method.

","Tryptophol Synthesis for Mitigating Amphibian Chytridiomycosis
","Amphibian populations worldwide are threatened by the disease Chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the aquatic fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Chytridiomycosis often leads to death; however, a few species of amphibians are resistant to the Chytridiomycosis infection. The resistance is conferred by symbiotic bacteria present on their skin that produce antifungal metabolites. The UFlorida iGEM team seeks to develop a new treatment for Chytridiomycosis based on these antifungal metabolites. One such antifungal compound, tryptophol, has been shown to be effective at combating Bd at low doses. Tryptophan is converted to tryptophol by three enzymes, Aromatic Amino Acid Aminotransferase II, 2-oxo Acid Decarboxylase, and Alcohol Dehydrogenase I. Our team modified E.coli with the genes comprising the pathway for tryptophol synthesis. The UFlorida team expects to demonstrate that the tryptophol from the genetically modified E. coli will show antifungal activity against the Chytridiomycota family as an antifungal treatment for amphibians.

","Development of an Aptameric Biosensor for Aflatoxin B1 in Peanuts
","The University of Georgias 2017 iGEM team aims to engineer a biosensor for the detection of aflatoxin B1, a harmful mycotoxin peanut contaminant. As Georgia produces more peanuts than any other state in the United States, UGA iGEM recognizes that aflatoxin B1 contamination in peanuts is a regionally important issue. While other iGEM teams have developed detection methods for aflatoxin B1, these methods lack high specificity. To achieve a highly-specific biosensor, UGA iGEM has incorporated an aflatoxin B1 aptamer that has previously been used for an in vitro detection assay. By mimicking this system in vivo, UGA iGEM is developing a cost-effective two-component riboswitch aflatoxin biosensor. This technology could be utilized in the manufacturing process to cut costs in recognizing infected peanuts. Moreover, by creating an affordable aptasensor, this will both make peanut crop growth more accessible to developing countries and decrease aflatoxin-related deaths worldwide.

","Development of a 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid Biosensor
","Many industrial manufacturing processes utilize the metabolite 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) as a platform chemical for the synthesis of complex biofuels and plastics. Current companies engineering bacteria to overproduce 3-HP utilize high-performance liquid chromatography to assay concentrations, which is a precise method for established bioreactors but time-consuming for testing experimental strains. Recent studies identified 3-HP responsive genes in Pseudomonas denitrificans and Pseudomonas putida, which could be used as a viable biosensor for real-time monitoring of 3-HP concentrations in vivo. Our ongoing research project utilizes the 3-HP responsive genes found in P. putida and P. denitrificans as biological reporters which express luciferase in the presence of 3-HP. We will then adapt this system to Bacillus subtilis, which has shown potential as a 3-HP producer for industrial processes due to its high tolerance for concentrations of 3-HP that are toxic in other microorganisms.  Our biosensor is a useful tool for metabolic engineering research.

Transferring the final genetic circuitry to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, a symbiont associated with the roots of the banana plant, will provide a soil additive capable of protecting banana crops from this threatening disease.

First, we identified a dsRNA-binding chaperone, Hfq, which acts to stabilize the sRNA-mRNA duplex in order to recruit RNase III to degrade the dsRNA. We then designed complimentary sRNAs for each mRNA target and tested the affinity of Hfq to our custom designed (AU)7A binding region on the sRNAs using a fluorescence polarization assay. The number of ribonucleotides cleaved from the binding region of Hfq via RNase III was determined via alkaline hydrolysis and long-format PAGE. Finally, Hfq and sRNA were co-transformed on a single vector to test gene knockdown efficiency.

Coupled with transcriptional and translational regulation, copy number control would offer an effective coordination and increased dynamic range of multiple gene expression. Therefore, we modified the ColE1 replicon to develop a synthetic origin of replication - SynORI - which enables the alteration of plasmid copy number. SynORI framework also incorporates a multi-plasmid regulation system based on uniquely barcoded regulatory RNA molecules, allowing to co-maintain different-group plasmids at preselected copy numbers in a standardized manner. In case certain plasmids are chosen to have a low copy number, an active partitioning system will minimize the risk of plasmid loss and increase the stability of our system. SynORI enables the creation of more complex metabolic pathways, smart assembly of protein complexes and a more precise information processing in synthetic biology.

","Sewage, PD
","Current wastewater treatment methods are complex and often difficult to maintain. During the biological nutrient removal process, sludge composed of co-cultures of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria converts ammonia and nitrites into inert nitrogen gas. Proper treatment of wastewater is important because the release of ammonia and nitrites poses health risks to humans. These toxic chemicals also fuel detrimental water eutrophication. Unfortunately, reaching optimal efficiency of the predominant nitrifier, Nitrosomonas europaea, requires aeration, which is costly for treatment facilities. Here we present a biological device that reduces aeration requirements and eliminates the need for co-cultures. We use a denitrifying bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans as a chassis for a device that contains a nitrification circuit taken from the genome of N. europaea. The addition of amoCAB, haoA, and the associated cytochrome genes creates a complete nitrogen removal system. Upon implementation, our device reduces the operating costs of wastewater treatment plants.

","Mantis: Modular antigen-based test for infectious diseases
","Over the last two decades epidemics of infectious diseases have caused major harm to the world population. These outbreaks often originate from developing countries, where diagnosis can be problematic. The Mantis project aims to detect antigens in blood samples of patients using an in vivo bacterial system, allowing for efficient diagnosis even in rural areas. Mantis is fast, robust, modular, and requires little equipment. Moreover, the whole-cell system allows for more affordable production and longer storage compared to current systems. Detection is based on affinity bodies, an antibody mimetic that can be produced by bacteria. Through rational design, the system can be adapted to detect a wide range of pathogens. The addition of the affinity body to a bacterial receptor will rapidly generate a clear fluorescent signal, measured by our portable, 3D-printed diagnostic device directly in the field. This way, Mantis will help diseases come to light.

","Application of optogenetic control mechanisms for manipulating biopolymer synthesis in advancing 3D printing technologies
","By providing a well-defined, biocompatible surface coating, the risk of bone and dental implant failure will be greatly reduced. We aim to accomplish this by controlling the spatial production of extra-cellular cellulose with light. Our modified E.coli builds on previous teams work, utilising a transmembrane protein complex, which upon exposure to red light, phosphorylates a promoter and initiates the synthesis cascade. Using this technology, our team will be able to build a 3D printer where living bacteria act as the bioink. Our team will then be able to produce cellulose structures, featuring micrometer pores, which mimic the surface of broken bone, for implants. This structure has been shown to promote osseointegration, helping to reduce overall failure rates.

","Viva Violacein - An Affordable Real-Time Metabolics Tracker
","Advances in synthetic biology have lead to new, useful metabolic pathways that can be used to produce metabolites on a commercially-viable scale. However, management of these cultures is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and measuring levels of metabolites often involves prohibitively expensive analytics, such as HPLC. Our project aims to overcome these problems by providing a low-cost, automated turbidostat bioreactor that analyzes a yeast culture in real time and corrects inputs to maintain culture conditions.
To test our system, we use the violacein metabolic pathway, regulated with inducible promoters, to yield four visually distinct pigments. An open-source Raspberry Pi computer collects color and opacity information about the culture, and software analyzes the color and gradually introduces the inducers to keep the cultures production stable. 
By combining biological, software, and hardware systems, our design can generate previously-unavailable visual data in certain biosynthesis processes, and has a wide range of applications in industrial fermentation.

","Operation: Ultraviolet
","Due to numerous climate effects, photosynthetic organisms are being damaged due to increased levels of harmful UV-B radiation. Luckily, many organisms exist that have a natural resistance to this kind of radiation. Using genes from the tardigrade species Ramazzottius Varieornatus, the bacteria species Deinococcus Radiodurans, and a strain of cyanobacteria, we hope to induce resistance to UV-B radiation damage. In order to demonstrate proof of these genes utility, our first step was to transform the genes into E. Coli. From there, we planned to test these transformed cells in our Environmental Simulation System by irradiating the cells and comparing their growth to that of a control. So far, we have found that E. Coli cells with Dsup are substantially more resistant to UV-B radiation, and we have also recorded preliminary data on uvsE as well. Currently, we are transforming the four genes into cyanobacteria and testing them under UV-B light.

However, there are also proteins that bear strong similarities to prions while not being associated with an infectious disease. These proteins have been deemed functional prions. Here, engineered functional prions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provide a proof of concept for using prions as a tool in synthetic biology to co-localize different proteins. These engineered proteins have prion-like aggregative behaviour, as well as a fluorescent tag. They will be used to test the viability of using engineered prions to bring and keep proteins in close proximity to each other while maintaining their function.

","The detection of quorum-sensing signalling molecules from Pseudonomas Putida via a novel biosensor
","AHL is a quorum-sensing molecule secreted by bacteria and is essential in biofilm formation. Biofilm is a collection of extracellular proteins and DNA which decreases sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is emerging as a world crisis with the NHS spending roughly £1 billion just on treating nosocomial infections. Multidrug resistant (MDR) gram negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas in particular are emerging as increasingly problematic bacterial species, especially in secondary infections. Therefore, we are aiming to develop strategies to help counter biofilm formation from the molecular level using synthetic biology, with the specific genes ppuR, ppuI and RsaL in Pseudomonas Putida being involved in the formation of the quorum sensing molecule AHL. A Biosensor can be developed to identify and decrease production of AHL, causing decreased biofilm formation and an increased sensitivity of the bacteria to antibiotics.

","Wow(WHU-iGEM operate wastewater)biodegradation of halogenated phenol in wastewater
","Widely used in agriculture and various industries, synthetic phenolic compounds commonly exist in wastewater and have been troublesome in wastewater treatment due to their remarkable stability and acute toxicity. They can accumulate through food chains and serve as mutagens and carcinogens to people and other organisms. Among them, halogenated phenolic compounds are notablely more toxic and less bio-degradable. Even when the number of halogen atoms increases, the toxicity of the whole molecule is raised as well . To deal with this serious problem, our team aims to construct a Hybrid Membrane Bioreactor to assist the degradation of halogenated phenolic compounds in wastewater. In this device, we intend to apply an engineered Bacillus megaterium which can mainly express an original reductive dehalogenase RdhANP. And we will also make some genetic changes on this B. megaterium to scale up its efficiency in treating the wastewater containing halogenated phenols.

","Modular Control of Gene Expression Speed using Protein Degradation Tags
","It has become apparent that a fundamental principle of cellular signal processing is the encoding of information within the temporal dynamics of regulatory circuits. For synthetic circuits to achieve the versatility and effectiveness of endogenous circuits, it is necessary to develop simple, effective methods to control a circuits speed. Current approaches to speed control are too complex for widespread use we lack a modular system that allows one to swap out a sequence to predictably change a genes speed just as swapping an RBS can change the genes expression strength. To address this need, we developed a BioBrick suite of degradation tags associated with an E. coli-orthogonal protease, providing the parts and characterization necessary for controlling genetic circuit speed in a simple, modular, and predictable way. Additionally, we created a searchable database of previous iGEM teams outreach projects, designed to better enable future teams to build upon previous outreach efforts.

","Phage Gauge: A novel method of detecting Escherichia coli in  contaminated water. 
","Escherichia coli infection is a common problem when water resources such as drinking water, beaches, or irrigation systems are contaminated with human waste. Infections by these bacteria can lead to severe gastrointestinal problems and even death if left untreated. Therefore, it is necessary to have water testing methods that can rapidly and accurately determine whether water sources contain these harmful pathogens.
     The WLC-iGEM team is working on developing a water testing kit that provides fast and accurate results using components of the Lambda Phage tail that are specific for their target bacteria. These bacteriophage tail components have been cloned and will be purified. By attaching a horseradish peroxidase enzyme (that will produce color when a substrate is added) to these bacteriophage components, E. coli should be able to be detected when present in a water sample. The high specificity and high concentration of bacteriophages should provide accurate and rapid results.

Meanwhile, miR-21 can be served as a therapeutic target by targeting many oncogenes in colorectal cancer. That had inspired us of using it as the new biomarker in diagnosing and treatment of colorectal cancer.
